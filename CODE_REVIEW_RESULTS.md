## Code Review Results

This document records the findings of the code review based on the plan in `CODE_REVIEW_PLAN.md`.

### 1. Architecture & Design

*   **End-to-end flow:** The `patient_sync` function is an HTTP-triggered Cloud Function that handles various synchronization operations. It receives a JSON payload, validates it, and then calls different internal functions based on the `operation` specified. The function includes structured logging, but there's no explicit mention of Redis or other downstream services in this file. The actual synchronization logic is stubbed out with placeholder comments.
*   **Shared Helpers:** There are several internal helper functions (`_validate_sync_payload`, `_process_sync_operation`, etc.), but no indication of shared helpers from a `templates` directory.
*   **/health route:** There is no `/health` route exposed in this function.
*   **Structured Logging:** The function uses Python's `logging` library with `basicConfig` to presumably output structured logs, but the format isn't explicitly defined here. The log messages include fields like `operation`, `patient_id`, etc.

### 7. Observability & Cost

*   **Alert Policies:** The file `monitoring/alerting-policies.yaml` defines several alert policies for high error rate, high memory usage, slow execution, security events, and deployment failures. This is a very positive finding.
*   **`health_dashboard.sh`:** As previously noted, this script is missing.
*   **Over-provisioned Resources:** The `cloudrun.yaml` file specifies `512Mi` of memory for a Cloud Run service. The `tebra-proxy` deployment scripts also specify `512Mi`. Without access to actual usage metrics, it's impossible to know if this is over-provisioned.
*   **Log-based Metrics:** There's no explicit configuration for excluding log-based metrics from the default Logging bucket.
