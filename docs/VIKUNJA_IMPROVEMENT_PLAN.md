---

## 🎯 Strategic Improvements

### 1. **Multi-Project Organization**

Instead of a single project, create specialized projects for different aspects:

```
📁 workflow-bolt (Main Project)
├── 🎯 AI Agent Development
├── 🔧 Infrastructure & DevOps
├── 🐛 Bug Tracking & Testing
├── 📚 Documentation & Knowledge
├── 🚀 Features & Enhancements
└── 🔒 Security & Compliance
```

### 2. **Enhanced Task Categories & Labels**

#### **Priority System (1-5)**
- **5 (Critical/Blocker)**: System down, security vulnerabilities, data loss
- **4 (High)**: Major bugs, critical features, production issues
- **3 (Medium)**: Normal development, improvements, technical debt
- **2 (Low)**: Nice-to-have features, documentation, cleanup
- **1 (Backlog)**: Future ideas, research, exploration

#### **Category Labels**
- `[CRITICAL_BUGS]` - System-breaking issues
- `[SECURITY]` - Security-related tasks
- `[INFRASTRUCTURE]` - DevOps, CI/CD, deployment
- `[AI_AGENTS]` - Agent development and coordination
- `[TESTING]` - Test improvements and failures
- `[DOCUMENTATION]` - Docs, guides, knowledge management
- `[FEATURES]` - New functionality
- `[REFACTORING]` - Code improvements
- `[COMPLIANCE]` - Regulatory and compliance work
- `[PERFORMANCE]` - Performance optimizations

#### **Status Labels**
- `[BLOCKED]` - Waiting for dependencies
- `[IN_PROGRESS]` - Currently being worked on
- `[REVIEW]` - Ready for review/testing
- `[DEPLOYED]` - Completed and deployed
- `[ARCHIVED]` - No longer relevant

### 3. **Task Lifecycle Management**

#### **Development Workflow**
```
Backlog → In Progress → Review → Testing → Deployed → Archived
```

#### **Bug Workflow**
```
Reported → Triaged → In Progress → Testing → Fixed → Verified
```

### 4. **Enhanced CLI Tools**

#### **New Scripts to Create**
- `scripts/vikunja-projects.cjs` - Multi-project management
- `scripts/vikunja-sprints.cjs` - Sprint planning and tracking
- `scripts/vikunja-reports.cjs` - Generate progress reports
- `scripts/vikunja-metrics.cjs` - Track velocity and metrics

#### **Improved Existing Scripts**
- Better task templates
- Automated status updates
- Integration with git commits
- Time tracking capabilities

### 5. **Integration Opportunities**

#### **Git Integration**
- Link tasks to commits/PRs
- Auto-update task status on merge
- Generate changelog from completed tasks

#### **CI/CD Integration**
- Auto-create tasks for failed builds
- Update task status based on deployment
- Link tasks to monitoring alerts

#### **AI Agent Integration**
- Agents can create/update tasks
- Automated task categorization
- Progress reporting from agents
