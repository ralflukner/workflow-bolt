# CLI Framework Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for the Command Line Interface (CLI) framework used within the workflow-bolt project. The CLI is built using the `oclif` framework and aims to provide a consistent, extensible, and user-friendly interface for various development, testing, and operational tasks.

## 2. Goals

- **Consistency:** Ensure a uniform structure and behavior across all CLI commands.
- **Extensibility:** Easily add new commands and functionalities without significant refactoring.
- **User-Friendliness:** Provide clear command summaries, descriptions, examples, and intuitive flag/argument handling.
- **Maintainability:** Promote modular and testable code for long-term sustainability.
- **Integration:** Facilitate integration with existing project scripts and workflows.

## 3. Architecture Overview (oclif)

The CLI leverages the `oclif` framework, which provides a robust structure for building CLIs. Key `oclif` concepts utilized include:

- **Commands:** Individual executable units (e.g., `health-check`, `import`).
- **Flags:** Options that modify command behavior (e.g., `--detailed`, `--json`).
- **Arguments:** Positional parameters passed to commands.
- **Topics:** Grouping related commands (e.g., `workflow-test import:schedule`).

### Directory Structure

- `src/cli/bin`: Contains the main executable script for the CLI.
- `src/cli/commands`: Houses individual command implementations (e.g., `health-check.ts`).
- `src/cli/lib`: Contains shared utilities or helper functions used across commands.
- `src/cli/fixtures`: Placeholder for test data or mock files for CLI testing.

## 4. Core Components and Patterns

### 4.1. Command Definition

Each command extends `oclif/core`'s `Command` class.

```typescript
import { Command, Flags } from '@oclif/core';

export default class MyCommand extends Command {
  static summary = 'A concise summary of the command.';
  static description = `
    A more detailed description of what the command does.
    Include usage examples.
  `;
  static examples = [
    '$ workflow-test mycommand --flag value',
  ];

  static flags = {
    // Define flags here
    myFlag: Flags.boolean({
      description: 'Description of myFlag',
      default: false,
    }),
  };

  static args = {
    // Define arguments here
  };

  async run(): Promise<void> {
    const { flags, args } = await this.parse(MyCommand);
    // Command logic here
  }
}
```

### 4.2. Flag and Argument Handling

- Use `Flags` and `Args` from `@oclif/core` for defining command-line options.
- Clearly describe each flag/argument's purpose and default value.
- Prefer descriptive flag names over single-character aliases unless widely understood.

### 4.3. Input Validation

- Implement robust validation for flags and arguments to ensure correct usage.
- Provide clear error messages for invalid inputs.

### 4.4. Output and Logging

- Use `this.log()` for standard output.
- Use `this.warn()` for warnings.
- Use `this.error()` for errors, which will also set the appropriate exit code.
- Utilize `chalk` for colored and formatted output to enhance readability.
- Support JSON output (`--json` flag) for programmatic consumption where applicable.

### 4.5. Error Handling

- Commands should gracefully handle errors and provide informative messages.
- Critical errors should lead to a non-zero exit code.
- Use `try-catch` blocks for asynchronous operations and external process executions.

## 5. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and methods within commands.
- **Integration Tests:** Verify the end-to-end execution of commands, including flag parsing and output.
- **Mocking:** Use mocking for external dependencies (e.g., file system, child processes) to ensure test isolation and speed.

## 6. Future Enhancements

- **Plugin System:** Explore `oclif`'s plugin capabilities for larger, more modular CLI features.
- **Interactive Prompts:** Integrate `inquirer` or similar libraries for interactive command flows.
- **Progress Indicators:** Add visual feedback for long-running operations.

**Question for Claude/Team:**

Are there any existing templates or specific guidelines for design documents that I should adhere to? For example, a preferred level of detail, specific sections to include/exclude, or a particular review process?
