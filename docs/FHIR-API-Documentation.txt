General

This guide is written for patients who wish to access their Electronic Health Information
(“EHI”) using an application of their choosing. This guide is also written for third party
developers who are developing software applications for patients, providers and/or systems
that wish to access identified EHI.


Tebra Technologies, d/b/a Kareo, Inc, provides FHIR APIs designed to satisfy the United States
Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI, version 1) requirements set forth by the Office of the
National Coordinator (ONC). The FHIR APIs are based on the HL7 FHIR US Core
Implementation Guide STU3 Release 3.1.1 which conform to the FHIR Version R4. Kareo’s
implementation of R4 version is ongoing and new resources will be added.


Kareo has elected to partner with SmileCDR, a third party provider of FHIR services. At the
time of registration, you will be required to accept SmileCDR’s terms and conditions.

Fees
There is no requirement for contracting with Kareo, Inc for the API read (GET) for USCDIv1
data for Patient APIs. There are not fees for patients accessing their health data through FHIR
APIs. There is no charge for usage of the read (GET) routes for USCDIv1 data for Patient APIs.

Clinician-focused and system bulk export applications will need to be registered with their
practice site and sign necessary business engagement documents and contracts. These
applications also require additional fees to enable workflow and system integration. Please
contact Kareo for further details.


Registration

Patients
Patients can access their health information by using a patient application that follows
the API specifications outlined elsewhere in this document and has been approved by
Kareo. Patients are encouraged to consider due diligence when selecting an application.
All applications are owned by third party developers and Kareo does not control their
design. However, Kareo does encourage all developers to review and implement in
accordance with ONC’s 2019 Model Privacy Notice guidelines.

Patients must have access to their provider’s patient portal in order to register to use
any patient app. Contact your physician’s office for details on how to obtain a portal
account.

Once a patient has access to their patient portal, the patient will need to consent to
sharing their clinical data with the mobile application. Detailed instructions are
available at Kareo’s Help Center (https://helpme.kareo.com/). All currently approved
apps will be shared after consent.

Technical Documentation

System Requirements
Apps using the Kareo FHIR API must be able to:

   ●   Support SMART on FHIR authentication framework
   ●   Connect via HTTPS with TLS 1.2 and 1.3
   ●   Store the client_id and client_secret for authentication
   ●   Process JSON response files


Authentication
Kareo FHIR Server uses the SMART Application Launch Framework Implementation
Guide (http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/1.0.0/) and provides an OAuth 2.0
compliant authorization server to enable patients and providers secure authentication
access to their health data. As described by the specification itself, SMART on FHIR:

“Connects third-party applications to Electronic Health Record data, allowing apps to
launch from inside or outside the user interface of an EHR system. The framework
supports apps for use by clinicians, patients, and others via PHR or Patient Portal or any
FHIR system where a user can give permissions to launch an app. It provides a reliable,
secure authorization protocol for a variety of app architectures, including apps that run
on an end-user’s device as well as apps that run on a secure server.”

Patient User Access

Through their selected application, patients will be prompted for their FHIR login and
credentials which they established in their patient portal accounts. SMART on FHIR
enables the user to authenticate themselves with our Kareo FHIR Authorization Server
and choose the scope of their patient data which they intend to access and share with
their application. This decision provides an access token to their application of choice,
and applications which are compliant with SMART on FHIR can then use this access
token to access their health data stored on the Kareo FHIR Server. These applications
will continue to have access to the patient data until the patient revokes their access
permission.

Clinician User Access

Clinician users of Kareo EHR can also use approved SMART on FHIR applications to
access patient data in the system. These clinician-focused applications will need to sign
the necessary business agreements with the practices to integrate with their provider

_____
© 2023 Tebra Technologies, Inc d/b/a Kareo, Inc. All rights reserved
accounts. Once approved and integrated within their practice, clinician users will create
or be assigned FHIR login credentials and then be able to use these SMART on FHIR
applications to access their Kareo EHR systems.

System or Bulk Data Access

Kareo FHIR Server also supports the FHIR Bulk Data Access framework
(http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/bulkdata/STU1/) for system-level access of large volumes of
data over FHIR. Like with clinician-focused applications, developers of FHIR Bulk clients
must sign any necessary business agreements and do additional integration steps to
make the application available to the practice’s patient accounts.

Bulk FHIR uses a JSON Web Token (JWT) to enable application authentication and
access between the application and the FHIR server. This will be established in the
initial setup and registration of the product.

Common Error Codes

Kareo makes every effort to ensure the FHI API works correctly. If there is an issue, the FHIR
API will return standard HTTP error messages. The most common are listed below.


Client Errors

 Code

 400         Bad Request                 The server cannot process the request due to an
                                         apparent client error.

 401         Unauthorized                The required authentication failed or was not
                                         provided.

 403         Forbidden                   A valid request was received, but refused by the

                                         server. Typically, this is due to the user not having the
                                         necessary permissions for the specified resource.

 404        Not Found                    The requested resource could not be found.

 408        Request Timeout              The server timed out waiting for the request.

 429        Too Many Requests            Too many requests have been sent in a given time
                                         period.


   ●    Check your API request for misspellings and other incorrect syntax.
   ●    Make sure the request has a valid token and matches the request.
   ●    Compare the request with the list of supported FHIR resources and scopes.


Server Errors

 Code

 500        Internal Server Error        A generic error message for an unexpected condition

 502        Bad Gateway                  The gateway proxy server received an invalid
                                         response from the upstream server

 503        Service Unavailable          The server cannot handle the request, typically
                                         because it is overloaded or down for maintenance.

 504        Gateway Timeout              The gateway/proxy server did not receive a timely
                                         response from the upstream server.


   ●    In case of a server error, first wait a few minutes before sending another request
