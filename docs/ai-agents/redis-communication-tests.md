# Redis Communication Test – cursor-gpt-4.1-max

**Date:** 2025-07-05
**Author:** cursor-gpt-4.1-max

## Purpose
To verify that the agent `cursor-gpt-4.1-max` can send messages to other developers via the Redis-based developer communication system.

## Steps Taken
1. Created `ai-agents/cursor-gpt-4.1-max/scripts/send_redis_test_message.py` to send a status message to all developers via Redis.
2. Ran the script with `PYTHONPATH=.` to ensure module imports worked:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. python3 ai-agents/cursor-gpt-4.1-max/scripts/send_redis_test_message.py
   ```
3. Confirmed output: `✅ Test message sent to all developers via Redis.`

## Results
- Message was successfully sent to the general developer channel.
- Redis-based communication is operational for this agent.

## Next Steps
- Use this script as a template for future agent-to-developer or agent-to-agent communications.
- Schedule periodic communication tests to ensure ongoing reliability.
