# Tebra Integration Fixes Summary

## Date: June 25, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tebra Sync "Unknown Error"

**Problem**: Firebase Functions were calling the wrong Cloud Run URL for the PHP API service.

**Root Cause**: The `tebra-proxy-client.js` had a hardcoded URL pointing to an old Cloud Run service that no longer exists:

```javascript
// Old (incorrect) URL
const cloudRunUrl = 'https://tebra-php-api-623450773640.us-central1.run.app';

// Fixed URL
const cloudRunUrl = 'https://tebra-php-api-xccvzgogwa-uc.a.run.app';
```

**Solution**: Updated the Cloud Run URL in `functions/src/tebra-proxy-client.js` and deployed the Firebase Functions.

### 2. PHP API Comparison Error

**Problem**: Fatal PHP error when comparing real data with hardcoded test data.

**Root Cause**: The `compareAppointmentData` function was receiving an object instead of an array, causing "Cannot use object of type stdClass as array" error.

**Solution**: Added object-to-array conversion and proper data extraction in `tebra-php-api/public/api.php`:

- Added check for object type and conversion to array
- Extracted actual data from response structure before comparison

### 3. Schedule Import Status Mapping

**Problem**: Imported appointments were not being set to the correct status (scheduled/confirmed).

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent status mapping in `ImportSchedule.tsx` - some statuses were being mapped to Title Case instead of lowercase kebab-case.

**Solution**: Fixed status mapping in `src/components/ImportSchedule.tsx`:

- 'rescheduled' → 'rescheduled' (was 'Rescheduled')
- 'cancelled' → 'cancelled' (was 'Cancelled')
- 'no show' → 'no-show' (was 'No Show')

## Architecture Clarification

The Tebra integration follows this flow:

1. **Frontend** → Calls Firebase Function `tebraProxy`
2. **Firebase Function** → Authenticates and forwards to Cloud Run PHP API
3. **Cloud Run PHP API** → Makes SOAP calls to Tebra
4. **Tebra SOAP API** → Returns appointment data

## Status Mapping Logic

Both manual import and Tebra sync use the same status mapping:

- **Tebra "Scheduled"** → Internal "scheduled"
- **Tebra "Confirmed"** → Internal "scheduled" (both map to the same status)
- **Tebra "Arrived"** → Internal "arrived"
- **Tebra "Roomed"** → Internal "appt-prep"

## Security Notes

- Cloud Run PHP API requires authentication (HIPAA compliant)
- API key is used for internal authentication between services
- All patient data is handled through secure channels

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Try syncing appointments from the Tebra Integration page
2. Import a schedule with various statuses to verify mapping
3. Check that both "Scheduled" and "Confirmed" appointments appear as "scheduled"

## Remaining Tasks

1. Replace the hardcoded Cloud Run URL with proper Secret Manager integration
2. Add better error handling and user-friendly messages
3. Consider adding retry logic for transient failures
