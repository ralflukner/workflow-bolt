# Tebra Appointment Sync - Debugging Progress Log

## Issue Summary

**Date:** June 11, 2025
**Problem:** Tebra SOAP proxy returning 0 appointments in Cloud Run, while local PHP scripts returned 8 appointments
**Status:** üõ†Ô∏è IN&nbsp;PROGRESS 

## Latest Progress (June 15, 2025)

- **Official Example Verified**: Running the exact Tebra PHP example locally returned real patient data (171+ records) proving credentials and API work.
- **Client Refactor**: `TebraHttpClient.php` updated to mirror the official pattern for `GetPatients`, `GetProviders`, and `GetAppointments`.
- **Deployment**: Deployed to Cloud Run (revision `tebra-php-api-00019-xs8`). HTTP 200 responses observed.
- **Current Blocker**: Tebra backend now returns `"Unable to find user."`‚Äîlikely an account activation/username formatting issue on Tebra side. No infrastructure or code errors observed.

Next steps:
1. Confirm with Tebra support that the integration user is fully activated.
2. Validate username formatting (case-sensitivity, domain, etc.).
3. Once user issue is resolved, re-run end-to-end tests.
