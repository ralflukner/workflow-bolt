        API INTEGRATION TECHNICAL GUIDE  Integrate Tebra with Third-Party Applications Using the Tebra Web Services API 2.1   Updated: April 2025   Introduction  Welcome to Tebra’s guide to integrating Tebra with third-party applications using the Tebra Web Services API! This guide shows you how to build software applications that access the Tebra Web Services API and provides a technical reference guide to the operations you can perform.  The Tebra Web Services API is an application programming interface that enables computer programs to access Tebra data and functionality by communicating with Tebra servers over the Internet. The Tebra Web Services API is built on the latest standards-based technologies used for web-based software integration including Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), Extensible Markup Language (XML), and Web Services Description Language (WSDL). This collection of technologies is commonly referred to as a “web services” interface. With the Tebra Web Services API, you can perform the following operations:  ➔ Retrieve data from different types of records in Tebra, including appointments, charges, patients, payments, procedure codes, providers, service locations, and transactions ➔ Insert different types of new records in Tebra, including appointments, patients, encounters, and payments ➔ Update different types of records in Tebra, including appointments, encounter status, and patients ➔ Remove appointment records in Tebra  The Tebra Web Services API can be used to:  ➔ Integrate patient and charge data from an electronic medical records (EMR) system with Tebra ➔ Interface financial data to be exported into an accounting system, such as QuickBooks ➔ Create your own computer programs to import data into Tebra ➔ And much more…  A triangle with a exclamation mark on it

Configuring Security and Access This topic provides instructions to get your customer key and how to grant the security permissions required by the Tebra Web Services API. 1.1 Getting Your Customer Key  For added security, Tebra requires an account-specific customer key to access your data outside of Tebra. When accessing data through the Tebra Web Services API, you must use the customer key with your Tebra login and password.  To get access to the customer key, a System Administrator for the account needs to create a Customer Care case for the request.  Once the My Account   3. The customer key displays next to Your key.     1.2 Granting Security Permissions To keep your data secure, a user with a System Administrator role must configure the permissions in Tebra before you can perform any operations using the API. Follow the appropriate steps below to grant user permissions. For     For    2. Using the Tebra Web Service API This topic provides general guidelines on how to use the Tebra Web Service API. 2.1 Connecting to the Tebra Web Service API  The Tebra Web Service API provides object schemas that can be downloaded into popular development tools (e.g., SoapUI) and enables developers to use structured objects for the request and response data used by each operation. Use the URL below to connect to the Tebra Web Services API. https://webservice.kareo.com/services/soap/2.1/KareoServices.svc?singleWsdl  2.2 XML Special Characters There is a set of special characters that are used in Extensible Markup Language (XML) to introduce an entity reference; therefore, they cannot be used directly to represent data in the XML file. The solution to this limitation is to use the escaped form (a special character reference) instead of the actual character. This is important for all fields, especially the Password field. If the escaped form of a special character is not used, it cannot be correctly parsed, and our authentication service will not recognize it. NAME  SPECIAL CHARACTER  ESCAPED FORM  Ampersand  &  &amp;  Less than  <  &lt;  Greater than  >  &gt;  Quote, Quotation Mark  “  &quot;  Apostrophe  ‘  &apos;    2.2 The RequestHeader Object  The RequestHeader object is required in every call to our services. This object contains the following fields: • CustomerKey: This is the customer key associated with your Tebra account. • User: This is the login for an authorized user account in Tebra. • Password: This is the password for an authorized user account in Tebra. 2.3 The ErrorResponse Object  The ErrorResponse object is returned in the response to every call to our services. This object contains the following fields: • IsError: This indicates whether or not there was an error with the call to the Tebra service. • ErrorMessage: This contains an error message when IsError is true. • StackTrace: This occasionally contains additional information when IsError is true. 2.4 The SecurityResponse Object The SecurityResponse object is returned in the response to every call to our services (except in some cases when there is an error). This object contains the following fields: • SecurityResultSuccess: This indicates whether or not the security check was a success. True would indicate that there was an issue with security. • SecurityResult: This contains a message that has more detail on the results of the security check. • Authenticated: Returns true if the login and password was valid. • Authorized: Returns true if the user is authorized to perform the operation. • CustomerId: Returns the unique identifier of the customer’s account. • PracticesAuthorized: Returns an array of practices the user has access to. • PermissionsMissing: Returns an array of the permissions missing to execute the request.   3. General Guidelines on Consuming Tebra API  This topic provides general guidelines on best practices when consuming the Tebra Web Services API. 3.1 Get Operations Field Request Only return fields you intend to use in the Get Operations. Most of the request objects for our Get operations accept a parameter named Fields that will take in a FieldsToReturn object specific to that call. An example would be the GetAppointmentsReq object has a field named Fields that takes the AppointmentFieldsToReturn object. The FieldsToReturn object allows you to indicate which fields you are interested in from the call. The more precise you are with the fields, the smaller the response will be from our API reducing the bandwidth required to complete the call.  3.2 Get Operations Filters Most of the request objects for our Get operations accept a parameter named Filter that will take in a Filter object specific to that call. An example would be the GetPatientsReq object has a field named Filter that takes the PatientFilter object. The Filter object allows you to limit the number of rows returned from the call. The best approach to filtering responses is to use PracticeName for all Get operations. The more precise you are with this the smaller the response will be from our API reducing the bandwidth and processing time required to complete the call. To avoid errors, at least one filter must be used for Get operations. If dates are used, the start and end dates must be used. For example, if you use FromCreateDate, you must also use ToCreateDate.  3.3 Polling Frequency  This is a general guideline to try and poll as infrequently as possible (e.g., every 2 hours instead of every 5 minutes) to reduce overall load on our systems, especially in scenarios where most calls return nothing new to process. In general, narrow your calls using the two suggestions above to have your call return in an acceptable amount of time.  To ensure that all users of Tebra's platform can have a consistent and reliable experience, the following rate limits are in effect: • GetAllPatients: 1 call every 5 seconds • GetAppointment: 1 call every ½ second • GetAppointments: 1 call per second  • GetCharges: 1 call per second  • GetEncounterDetails: 1 call every ½ second • GetExternalVendors: 1 call per second • GetPatient: 1 call every ¼ second • GetPatients: 1 call per second • GetPayments: 1 call per second • GetPractices: 1 call every ½ second • GetProcedureCode: 1 call every ½ second • GetProviders: 1 call every ½ second • GetServiceLocations: 1 call every ½ second • GetThrottles: 1 call every 5 seconds • GetTransactions: 1 call per second • CreateAppointment:  1 call every ½ second • CreateEncounter: 1 call every ½ second • CreatePatient: 1 call every ½ second • CreatePayments: 1 call every ½ second • UpdateAppointment: 1 call every ½ second • UpdateEncounterStatus: 1 call every ½ second • UpdatePatient: 1 call per second • DeleteAppointment: 1 call every ½ second • SearchPatient: 1 call every ¼ second Rate limits are measured at the Tebra account level (Account ID). Should limits be exceeded, the system will respond with an error message specifying the endpoint and rate limit. For example, “429: GetPatients endpoint requested more than allowed over time interval 1000 milliseconds. Please wait to try again.” It is recommended to either implement a delay between calls and/or a retry procedure when appropriate. Which endpoints have rate limits implemented, and the respective limits, are subject to change. 3.4 Query API Afterhours  The performance of our API is generally better during off hours. If it is not critical to run your integration with the Tebra Web Services API during business hours, schedule it during afterhours. This prevents your account from experiencing possible degraded performance.  4.
