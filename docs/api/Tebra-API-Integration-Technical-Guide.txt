 Integrate Tebra with Third-
 Party Applications Using the
 Tebra Web Services API 2.1
 Updated: April 2025
Introduction
Welcome to Tebra’s guide to integrating Tebra with third-party
applications using the Tebra Web Services API! This guide shows you how
to build software applications that access the Tebra Web Services API and
provides a technical reference guide to the operations you can perform.

The Tebra Web Services API is an application programming interface that enables computer
programs to access Tebra data and functionality by communicating with Tebra servers over the
Internet. The Tebra Web Services API is built on the latest standards-based technologies used
for web-based software integration including Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP),
Extensible Markup Language (XML), and Web Services Description Language (WSDL). This
collection of technologies is commonly referred to as a “web services” interface.


With the Tebra Web Services API, you can perform the following operations:

    ➔ Retrieve data from different types of records in Tebra, including appointments, charges,
      patients, payments, procedure codes, providers, service locations, and transactions
    ➔ Insert different types of new records in Tebra, including appointments, patients,
      encounters, and payments
    ➔ Update different types of records in Tebra, including appointments, encounter status,
      and patients
    ➔ Remove appointment records in Tebra

The Tebra Web Services API can be used to:

    ➔ Integrate patient and charge data from an electronic medical records (EMR) system
      with Tebra
    ➔ Interface financial data to be exported into an accounting system, such as QuickBooks
    ➔ Create your own computer programs to import data into Tebra
    ➔ And much more…

    Important Note: This guide is written for a technical audience. The information in this
guide is intended to be used by IT staff or consultants affiliated with Tebra customers or
software developers affiliated with third-party software companies seeking to integrate their
products with Tebra.

1. Configuring Security and Access

This topic provides instructions to get your customer key and how to grant the security
permissions required by the Tebra Web Services API.


1.1 Getting Your Customer Key

For added security, Tebra requires an account-specific customer key to access your data
outside of Tebra. When accessing data through the Tebra Web Services API, you must use the
customer key with your Tebra login and password.

To get access to the customer key, a System Administrator for the account needs to create a
Customer Care case for the request.


 Once the request is completed for the
 account, the Get Customer Key option is
 available through My Account. A user with a
 System Administrator role can access the
 customer key by following the steps below.

 1. Log into My Account with the user login
    email and password associated with the
    Tebra account. The My Account page
    opens.

 2. Click Get Customer Key. The Get
    Customer Key page opens.



 3. The customer key displays next to Your
    key.

2. Using the Tebra Web Service API

This topic provides general guidelines on how to use the Tebra Web Service API.


2.1 Connecting to the Tebra Web Service API

The Tebra Web Service API provides object schemas that can be downloaded into popular
development tools (e.g., SoapUI) and enables developers to use structured objects for the
request and response data used by each operation. Use the URL below to connect to the Tebra
Web Services API.

         https://webservice.kareo.com/services/soap/2.1/KareoServices.svc?singleWsdl



2.2 XML Special Characters

There is a set of special characters that are used in Extensible Markup Language (XML) to
introduce an entity reference; therefore, they cannot be used directly to represent data in the
XML file. The solution to this limitation is to use the escaped form (a special character
reference) instead of the actual character. This is important for all fields, especially the
Password field. If the escaped form of a special character is not used, it cannot be correctly
parsed, and our authentication service will not recognize it.


 NAME                                       SPECIAL CHARACTER                    ESCAPED FORM

 Ampersand                                  &                                    &amp;
 Less than                                  <                                    &lt;
 Greater than                               >                                    &gt;
 Quote, Quotation Mark                      “                                    &quot;
 Apostrophe                                 ‘                                    &apos;

2.2 The RequestHeader Object

The RequestHeader object is required in every call to our services. This object contains the
following fields:

    •    CustomerKey: This is the customer key associated with your Tebra account.
    •    User: This is the login for an authorized user account in Tebra.
    •    Password: This is the password for an authorized user account in Tebra.


2.3 The ErrorResponse Object

The ErrorResponse object is returned in the response to every call to our services. This object
contains the following fields:

    •    IsError: This indicates whether or not there was an error with the call to the Tebra
         service.
    •    ErrorMessage: This contains an error message when IsError is true.
    •    StackTrace: This occasionally contains additional information when IsError is true.


2.4 The SecurityResponse Object

The SecurityResponse object is returned in the response to every call to our services (except in
some cases when there is an error). This object contains the following fields:

    •    SecurityResultSuccess: This indicates whether or not the security check was a success.
         True would indicate that there was an issue with security.
    •    SecurityResult: This contains a message that has more detail on the results of the
         security check.
    •    Authenticated: Returns true if the login and password was valid.
    •    Authorized: Returns true if the user is authorized to perform the operation.
    •    CustomerId: Returns the unique identifier of the customer’s account.
    •    PracticesAuthorized: Returns an array of practices the user has access to.
    •    PermissionsMissing: Returns an array of the permissions missing to execute the
         request.

3. General Guidelines on Consuming Tebra API

This topic provides general guidelines on best practices when consuming the Tebra Web
Services API.


3.1 Get Operations Field Request

Only return fields you intend to use in the Get Operations. Most of the request objects for our
Get operations accept a parameter named Fields that will take in a FieldsToReturn object
specific to that call. An example would be the GetAppointmentsReq object has a field named
Fields that takes the AppointmentFieldsToReturn object.

The FieldsToReturn object allows you to indicate which fields you are interested in from the
call. The more precise you are with the fields, the smaller the response will be from our API
reducing the bandwidth required to complete the call.


3.2 Get Operations Filters

Most of the request objects for our Get operations accept a parameter named Filter that will
take in a Filter object specific to that call. An example would be the GetPatientsReq object has
a field named Filter that takes the PatientFilter object.

The Filter object allows you to limit the number of rows returned from the call. The best
approach to filtering responses is to use PracticeName for all Get operations. The more precise
you are with this the smaller the response will be from our API reducing the bandwidth and
processing time required to complete the call.

To avoid errors, at least one filter must be used for Get operations. If dates are used, the start
and end dates must be used. For example, if you use FromCreateDate, you must also use
ToCreateDate.


3.3 Polling Frequency

This is a general guideline to try and poll as infrequently as possible (e.g., every 2 hours instead
of every 5 minutes) to reduce overall load on our systems, especially in scenarios where most
calls return nothing new to process. In general, narrow your calls using the two suggestions
above to have your call return in an acceptable amount of time.

To ensure that all users of Tebra's platform can have a consistent and reliable experience, the
following rate limits are in effect:

    •    GetAllPatients: 1 call every 5 seconds
    •    GetAppointment: 1 call every ½ second
    •    GetAppointments: 1 call per second
    •    GetCharges: 1 call per second
    •    GetEncounterDetails: 1 call every ½ second
    •    GetExternalVendors: 1 call per second
    •    GetPatient: 1 call every ¼ second
    •    GetPatients: 1 call per second
    •    GetPayments: 1 call per second
    •    GetPractices: 1 call every ½ second
    •    GetProcedureCode: 1 call every ½ second
    •    GetProviders: 1 call every ½ second
    •    GetServiceLocations: 1 call every ½ second
    •    GetThrottles: 1 call every 5 seconds
    •    GetTransactions: 1 call per second
    •    CreateAppointment: 1 call every ½ second
    •    CreateEncounter: 1 call every ½ second
    •    CreatePatient: 1 call every ½ second
    •    CreatePayments: 1 call every ½ second
    •    UpdateAppointment: 1 call every ½ second
    •    UpdateEncounterStatus: 1 call every ½ second
    •    UpdatePatient: 1 call per second
    •    DeleteAppointment: 1 call every ½ second
    •    SearchPatient: 1 call every ¼ second

Rate limits are measured at the Tebra account level (Account ID). Should limits be exceeded,
the system will respond with an error message specifying the endpoint and rate limit. For
example, “429: GetPatients endpoint requested more than allowed over time interval 1000
milliseconds. Please wait to try again.”

It is recommended to either implement a delay between calls and/or a retry procedure when
appropriate.

Which endpoints have rate limits implemented, and the respective limits, are subject to
change.

3.4 Query API Afterhours

The performance of our API is generally better during off hours. If it is not critical to run your
integration with the Tebra Web Services API during business hours, schedule it during
afterhours. This prevents your account from experiencing possible degraded performance.
