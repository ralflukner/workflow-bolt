Introduction 
This guide is written for third party developers or  
patients who are developing software applications for 
accessing Protected Health Information (PHI) of patients on the Kareo Platform.  This documentation outlines the authentication details and methods to connect to the API to retrieve patient health information.  
SECTION ONE 


API Terms of Use 
1) Acceptance of Terms 
You must accept this Kareo Terms of Use (“Agreement”) in order to use the Kareo public Application Programming Interface (“API”). This Agreement describes your rights and your obligations if you use the Kareo API. It is important that you read the Agreement carefully because you will be legally bound to these terms and your use of the Kareo API is subject to this Agreement. By accepting this Agreement or by accessing or using the Kareo API, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. 
If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity (“Entity”), you represent that you have the authority to bind such Entity to this Agreement. In that case, the terms “you” or “your” shall also refer to such Entity. If you do not have such authority, or if the Entity does not agree to be bound by this Agreement, the Entity and you may not use the Kareo API. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and Kareo, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and Kareo. 
2) API Definitions 
a) 
Application: Any software application, website, or product you create, or service you offer, using the Kareo API; b) API Documentation: The documentation, data and information that Kareo provides regarding use of the Kareo API through the Developer Site; 

c) 
Developer Site: Kareo's MACRA information and tools for developers is found at www. kareo.com\macra ; d) Kareo API: The publicly available Kareo Application Programming Interface (“API”) as well as the related API Documentation; e) Kareo Brand: The Kareo brand and brand assets, including names, logos, trade names and trademarks. 



3) API License 
Kareo hereby grants you a revocable, limited, personal, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, and non-transferable license to use the API to develop, test, and support your Application, and to integrate the Kareo API with your Application. Your license is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4 and Section 9 below. 


4) Use of APIs and Kareo Data 
4.1 You may not use the Kareo API in a manner that accesses or uses any information 
beyond what Kareo allows under this Agreement or the API Documentation; that 
changes, breaks or circumvents any of Kareo's technical, administrative, process or 
security measures; that disrupts or degrades the performance of the Kareo API; or that 
tests the vulnerability of Kareo's systems or networks. 
4.2 You may not transmit any viruses or other computer programming that may damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system or data. 
4.3 You may not attempt to reverse engineer or otherwise derive source code, trade 
secrets, or know-how in the Kareo API or any portion thereof; 
4.4 You may not use the Kareo API to replicate or compete with core products or services 
offered by Kareo. You acknowledge and agree that Kareo has or may in the future offer 
products or services that are similar to your Application, and nothing will prevent 
Kareo from doing so; 
4.5 You may charge for your Application. However, you may not sell, rent, lease, sublicense, redistribute, or syndicate access to the Kareo API. 
4.6 You may place advertisements on and around your Application. However, you may not: 
a) place any advertisements that resemble or are reasonably likely to confuse users as 
being a message from Kareo; or b) use any content from Kareo in any advertisements 
or for purposes of targeting advertisements, in your Application or elsewhere. 
4.7 You will not attempt to exceed or circumvent limitations on access, calls and use of the Kareo API, or otherwise use the Kareo API in a manner that exceeds reasonable request volume, constitutes excessive or abusive usage, or otherwise fails to comply or is inconsistent with any part of this Agreement or the Documentation. 
4.8 You may not use the Kareo API in any Application that includes adult content, promotes gambling, involves the sale of tobacco or alcohol to persons under 21 years of age, or otherwise violates any applicable law or regulation. 
4.9 You may not distribute or allow access to the Kareo API to anyone other than, if applicable, the Entity on whose behalf you entered into this Agreement. 
5) Security Measures 
5.1 The network, operating system and software of your web servers, databases, and computer systems (collectively, “Your Systems”) must be properly configured to 
securely operate your Application. Your Application must use reasonable security measures to protect your users' information. You must not architect or select Your Systems in a manner to avoid the foregoing obligation. 

5.2 You must promptly report any security deficiencies in, or intrusions to, your Systems to 
Kareo in writing via email to security@kareo.com or subsequent contact information posted on the Developer Site. You will work with Kareo to immediately correct any 
security deficiency, and will immediately disconnect any intrusions or intruder. In the event of any security deficiency or intrusion involving the Application, or the Kareo API, you will make no public statements regarding such deficiencies or intrusions (e.g., 
press, blogs, social media, bulletin boards, etc.) without prior written and express 
permission from Kareo in each instance. 


6) Ownership 
As between you and Kareo, Kareo owns all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to, the Kareo API, Documentation, and all elements and components thereof (collectively, the “Kareo Materials”). Except for the express license granted in this Agreement, Kareo does not grant you any right, title, or interest in or to the 
Kareo Materials. If you provide any feedback (“Feedback" is defined as any 
recommendations, enhancements, requests, suggestions or other similar activity) to Kareo regarding the Kareo API or Documentation, you hereby agree that Kareo will own any such Feedback and you hereby grant Kareo a perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide, and royalty-free license to use the Feedback for the purpose of improving and creating derivative works of Kareo's API and Documentation.

7.3.1 All rights and licenses granted to you will terminate immediately. 
7.3.2 You will promptly destroy Documentation and any other Kareo information in your possession or control that was received under this Agreement. 


8) Modifications to this Agreement 
Kareo may change, add to or delete any portion of this Agreement in its sole discretion. If Kareo does so, it will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the changes either by emailing the email address associated with your account or by posting a notice on the Developer Site. Your continued access or use of the Kareo API will mean that you agree to the changes. 

9) Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability; Indemnity 
9.1 NO WARRANTIES. THE KAREO API AND ALL RELATED COMPONENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND KAREO EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT KAREO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE KAREO API WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE OR VIRUS-FREE, NOR DOES IT MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE KAREO API, AND NO INFORMATION, ADVICE OR SERVICES OBTAINED BY YOU FROM KAREO OR THROUGH THE DEVELOPER SITE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT. 
9.2 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL KAREO BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, OR LOST DATA, OR (B) ANY MATTER BEYOND KAREO's REASONABLE CONTROL. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES, AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED ON THESE LIMITATIONS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHICH MEANS THAT SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, KAREO'S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 
9.3 Indemnity. You agree to defend, hold harmless and indemnify Kareo, and its 
subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and suppliers, from and against 
any third party claim arising from or in any way related to your or your users' use of the Application or the Kareo API, or any violation of this Agreement, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees, of every kind and nature. In such a case, we will provide you with written notice of such claim, suit, or action. 

10) Dispute Resolution 
Any claim, cause of action or dispute (“Claim") arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of California, United States, regardless of your 
country of origin or where you access the Kareo API, and notwithstanding any conflicts of 
law principles and the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods. You and Kareo agree that all Claims arising out of or related to this Agreement must be resolved exclusively in the courts located in the county of Orange, California or the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. You and Kareo agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Orange, California or the Central District of California, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts for the purpose of litigating all such Claims. Notwithstanding the above, you agree that Kareo shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies in any jurisdiction. 

11) General Legal Terms 
11.1 If any provision of this Agreement is found to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, the 
unenforceable provision will be modified so as to render it enforceable to the maximum extent possible in order to effect the intention of the provision; if a term cannot be so modified, it will be severed and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be affected in any way. 
11.2 You will comply with all applicable law, regulations and third-party rights (including, without limitation, HIPAA regulations and privacy laws). 
11.3 Notice and Service of Process. We may notify you via postings on the Developer Site or via the email address associated with your Application. Kareo accepts service of process by mail or courier at the physical address set forth in Section 11.6 below. Any notices that you provide without compliance with this section shall have no legal 
effect. 
11.4 This Agreement and the API Documentation, constitute the entire agreement between you and Kareo regarding the Kareo API and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. 
11.5 Our failure to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to that breach or subsequent similar or other breaches. 
SECTION TWO 




General Concepts 
Connecting to the Server 
The APIs may only be accessed by clients through an https (SSL/TLS 1.1) connection. Limit your connection frequency as appropriate for your use case. Connection attempts which are more frequent than permitted are not allowed. 

Authentication 
Generating an API Key 
An API Key can be generated by logging into the Kareo Patient Portal.  New API Keys can be generated by accessing the Patient Portal and navigating to "My Account" > "API Access Key" 
Extra precautions need to be exercised to prevent unauthorized access to the API Key. 

API Key Usage 
All requests to the API must include the API Key transmitted in the HTTP header parameter "X-Api-Key".  If the API Key is missing, revoked or otherwise not valid, the API will return a 401 (Unauthorized). 


API Key Revocation 
At any point, the patient may revoke and thus invalidating their current generated API Key.  If an existing API Key is revoked, all API requests using the revoked key will return a 403 (Forbidden) response. 


Response 
Content Type 
All API response content types are "application/json".
