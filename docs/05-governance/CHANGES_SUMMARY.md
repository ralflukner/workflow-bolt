# 2025-06-23  Documentation Re-org & Encryption Road-map Kick-off

**Highlights**

1. **Documentation Re-organisation Phase 1 completed**
   • Created canonical folder structure (`00-overview … 05-governance`).
   • Re-wrote `00-overview/overview.md` with full application tour.
   • Relocated `recommendation.md` and Firebase startup issue doc into proper sub-directories, deleting old copies.
   • Added progress tracker and timestamp table to `docs/DOCUMENTATION_REORG_PLAN.md`.

2. **Encryption redesign road-map drafted**
   • Decision to adopt envelope encryption with KEK in Google Secret Manager and per-record DEKs.
   • Plan to drop redundant IV field, embed IV in ciphertext, introduce `ENC1:` payload version tag.
   • Key-rotation strategy (90-day KEK rotation via Cloud Scheduler) documented.

3. **Versioning**
   • Proposed semantic bump to `0.1.1-docs+crypto` after SecureStorage v2 lands.

**Files Added / Modified**

- `docs/00-overview/overview.md` (major rewrite)
- `docs/debugging/FIREBASE_FUNCTIONS_STARTUP_ISSUE.md` (relocated)
- `docs/05-governance/recommendation.md` (relocated)
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_REORG_PLAN.md` (progress table & log)

# Changes Summary: Patient Data Persistence Fix

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: Patient data was not persisting through browser refreshes because
Firebase wasn't configured for local development.

**Solution**: Implemented a dual-storage system that automatically falls back
to browser localStorage when Firebase isn't available.

## Files Modified

### 1. **NEW FILE**: `src/services/localStorage/localSessionService.ts`

- **Purpose**: Browser-based persistence service for local developmen

- **Key Features**:
  - Synchronous localStorage operations
  - Daily session management with auto-cleanup
  - Same interface as Firebase service for seamless switching
  - Session statistics for monitoring

### 2. **MODIFIED**: `src/context/PatientContext.tsx`

- **Changes**:
  - Added dynamic storage service selection based on Firebase availability
  - Enhanced auto-load with better error handling
  - Improved auto-save logic with debouncing
  - Added storage type logging for debugging
  - Fixed async/sync handling for different storage types

### 3. **MODIFIED**: `src/components/PersistenceStatus.tsx`

- **Changes**:
  - Added storage type detection and visual indicators
  - Created union types for Firebase vs localStorage statistics
  - Enhanced UI with storage-specific information
  - Added conditional displays based on storage capabilities

### 4. **MODIFIED**: `src/services/localStorage/localSessionService.ts`

- **User Changes Applied**:
  - Made `saveTodaysSession` synchronous (removed async)
  - Changed stats interface to use `patientCount` instead of `totalSessions`
  - Added `lastUpdated` timestamp tracking

### 5. **NEW FILE**: `PERSISTENCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation of the persistence system

- **Contents**: Architecture, implementation details, troubleshooting guide

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Data Persistence Fixed**

- Patient data now survives browser refresh, restart, and computer reboo

- Automatic fallback to localStorage when Firebase isn't configured

- No more data loss during developmen

### ✅ **Enhanced User Experience**

- Visual indicators show which storage system is active

- Real-time persistence status with session statistics

- Clear console logging for debugging

- Manual save/clear controls

### ✅ **HIPAA Compliance Maintained**

- Firebase mode: 24-hour retention with automatic purging

- LocalStorage mode: Daily cleanup for privacy

- Only real patient data auto-saves (not mock data)

### ✅ **Developer Experience**

- Works out-of-the-box without Firebase configuration

- Seamless switching between development and production

- Better error handling and debugging information

## Testing Status

- ✅ **LocalStorage Mode**: Fully functional for local developmen

- ✅ **Auto-save**: Triggers on patient data changes (2s debounce)

- ✅ **Auto-load**: Loads saved data on app startup

- ✅ **Manual Controls**: Save/clear operations working

- ✅ **Daily Cleanup**: Old sessions automatically removed

- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks on storage failures

## Usage

### **Local Development** (No Firebase)

1. Add patients → Data automatically saves to localStorage
2. Refresh browser → Patients remain loaded
3. Restart computer → Patients still available
4. Next day → Automatic cleanup, fresh star

### **Production** (With Firebase)

1. Configure Firebase environment variables
2. System automatically switches to cloud storage
3. Data syncs across devices/users
4. HIPAA-compliant daily purging

## Console Messages to Look For

- `"Using LocalStorage for data persistence"` - Development mode active

- `"Local session saved for YYYY-MM-DD"` - Data successfully saved

- `"Local session loaded for YYYY-MM-DD"` - Data successfully loaded

- `"Found old session (date), clearing for new day"` - Automatic cleanup

---

**Result**: Patient data persistence now works reliably in both developmen

## 2025-07-05 – Redis Communication Test & Project Management Database Decision

- Verified Redis-based agent-to-developer communication for cursor-gpt-4.1-max using a custom test script.
- Documented successful test and recommended periodic checks for ongoing reliability.
- Evaluated project management database options; selected self-hosted Plane.so for real-time, API-driven collaboration.
- Documented rationale, implementation steps, and migration plan for Plane.so adoption.
