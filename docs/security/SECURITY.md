# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures and best practices for the Tebra EHR Integration system.

## Security Overview

The Tebra EHR Integration implements multiple layers of security to protect sensitive healthcare data and ensure HIPAA compliance.

## Authentication & Authorization

### API Authentication

- All API requests must use HTTPS

- API credentials are stored in environment variables

- Credentials are never committed to version control

- Regular credential rotation is enforced

### User Authentication

- Firebase Authentication for user management

- Multi-factor authentication support

- Session management with secure tokens

- Automatic session timeout

## Data Protection

### Data in Transit

- All API communications use TLS 1.2 or higher

- SOAP messages are encrypted

- WebSocket connections are secured

- Certificate pinning for API endpoints

### Data at Rest

- Firebase Firestore encryption

- Secure storage of sensitive data

- Regular security audits

- Data backup and recovery procedures

## HIPAA Compliance

### Protected Health Information (PHI)

- PHI is encrypted at rest and in transit

- Access to PHI is logged and audited

- Minimum necessary data principle

- Data retention policies

### Audit Trail

- All PHI access is logged

- Regular audit log reviews

- Automated anomaly detection

- Compliance reporting

## Security Best Practices

### Development

1. **Code Security**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Security-focused code reviews
   - Static code analysis
   - Automated security testing

2. **Environment Security**
   - Secure development environments
   - Production environment isolation
   - Regular security patches
   - Access control policies

3. **Deployment Security**
   - Secure CI/CD pipelines
   - Automated security checks
   - Environment validation
   - Deployment verification

### Operational Security

1. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time security monitoring
   - Intrusion detection
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking

2. **Incident Response**
   - Security incident procedures
   - Response team contacts
   - Communication protocols
   - Recovery procedures
