# Patient Encryption Key Resolution

## Summary

The patient encryption key errors have been resolved by:

1. **Added PATIENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY to allowed secrets** in `functions/src/get-secret.js`
   - This allows the frontend to retrieve the encryption key via Firebase Functions

2. **Deployed updated Firebase Functions**
   - The getSecret function now includes PATIENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY in the whitelist
   - Old Tebra Node.js functions were successfully deleted

3. **Updated environment variables**
   - Ran `scripts/pull-secrets.js` to pull the encryption key from GSM
   - Added REACT_APP_PATIENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY to .env file

## How it Works

The patient encryption system now works as follows:

1. **Frontend requests encryption key** via `secretsService.getSecret('PATIENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY')`
2. **SecretsService checks multiple sources**:
   - First tries browser cache
   - Then calls Firebase Function `getSecret` with the key name
   - Falls back to environment variable if needed
3. **Firebase Function validates request**:
   - Requires authentication
   - Checks if PATIENT_ENCRYPTION_KEY is in allowed list
   - Retrieves from Google Secret Manager
   - Returns to frontend
4. **Encryption service uses key** to encrypt/decrypt patient PHI data

## Security Features

- ✅ Encryption key never exposed in client-side code
- ✅ Retrieved securely via authenticated Firebase Function
- ✅ Stored in Google Secret Manager (HIPAA compliant)
- ✅ Rate limited to prevent abuse
- ✅ Cached for performance with TTL

## Testing

The application should now:

1. Start without encryption key errors
2. Successfully encrypt/decrypt patient data
3. Maintain HIPAA compliance for PHI

## Next Steps

If any issues persist:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firebase is initialized before secret requests
3. Ensure user is authenticated before accessing patient data
