# Recent Changes

This document tracks significant recent changes to the Patient Flow Management application.

## Version 0.1.0 Release (May 2025)

The first minor version release includes significant improvements to time handling, component architecture, and code organization:

### 1. Real-Time Updates and Time Synchronization

- Updated TimeContext to refresh time every second instead of every minute
- Made getCurrentDisplayTime use stored time consistently for better reliability
- Enhanced TimeControl component with useEffect and state to react to time changes
- Modified PatientCard to calculate wait times dynamically instead of once per render
- Revised PatientContext to use separate update intervals for real-time (6s) and simulation (1s) modes
- Expanded waitingPatients definition in metrics to include additional patient statuses
- Ensured consistent time handling and formatting across components
- Added proper cleanup for interval timers to prevent memory leaks
- Moved context hooks to separate files to fix ESLint warnings and improve Fast Refresh compatibility

### 2. Auth0 Authentication Integration

- Implemented secure authentication using Auth0
- Added protected routes to secure application content
- Configured proper session persistence and redirect handling
- Enhanced error handling for authentication flows

## TypeScript Improvements (April 2025)

A series of improvements were made to enhance type safety and resolve TypeScript errors:

### 1. Expanded AppointmentStatus Type

The `AppointmentStatus` type was expanded to include a comprehensive set of statuses:

```typescript
// Before
export type AppointmentStatus = 'Scheduled' | 'Confirmed' | 'Cancelled';

// After
export type AppointmentStatus = 
  | 'Scheduled'
  | 'Reminder Sent'
  | 'Confirmed'
  | 'Arrived'
  | 'Checked In'
  | 'Roomed'
  | 'Appt Prep Started'
  | 'Ready for MD'
  | 'Seen by MD'
  | 'Checked Out'
  | 'No Show'
  | 'Rescheduled'
  | 'Cancelled';
```

This change provides more granular status tracking and better alignment with medical office workflows.

### 2. React Type Definitions

Added missing React type definition packages:

```bash
npm install @types/react @types/react-dom
```

This resolves TypeScript errors related to React JSX elements.

### 3. TypeScript Configuration Enhancements

Updated `tsconfig.app.json` with improved React support:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // existing options...

    /* Additional settings */
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  },
  // ...
}
```

These settings improve compatibility with React's module system and prevent import-related errors.

### 4. PatientCard Component Type Safety

Enhanced type safety in the PatientCard component:

- Added return type annotations to all functions
- Created an ActionButton interface for button configuration
- Added explicit type annotations for event handlers
- Fixed dynamic color classes with a type-safe lookup object

```typescript
// Before (dynamic class generation, potential runtime issue)
className={`mt-2 px-3 py-1 bg-${button.color}-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-${button.color}-600 transition-colors`}

// After (type-safe color mapping)
const buttonColors: Record<string, string> = {
  amber: 'bg-amber-500 hover:bg-amber-600',
  purple: 'bg-purple-500 hover:bg-purple-600',
  // Other colors...
};

className={`mt-2 px-3 py-1 ${buttonColors[button.color]} text-white rounded transition-colors`}
```

This change prevents potential runtime errors from dynamic class generation in Tailwind.

### 5. Enhanced Appointment Status UI

Updated the PatientCard component to display appointment statuses with appropriate color coding:

```typescript
patient.appointmentStatus === 'Confirmed' ? 'bg-blue-600 text-white' : 
patient.appointmentStatus === 'Reminder Sent' ? 'bg-indigo-600 text-white' : 
patient.appointmentStatus === 'Arrived' || patient.appointmentStatus === 'Checked In' || patient.appointmentStatus === 'Roomed' ? 'bg-green-600 text-white' : 
patient.appointmentStatus === 'Appt Prep Started' || patient.appointmentStatus === 'Ready for MD' || patient.appointmentStatus === 'Seen by MD' || patient.appointmentStatus === 'Checked Out' ? 'bg-teal-600 text-white' : 
'bg-red-600 text-white'
```

This provides better visual distinction between different appointment statuses.

## Future Changes

Planned improvements include:

1. **Refactor Status Display Logic**: Move the status color logic into utility functions or constants
2. **Accessibility Improvements**: Add ARIA attributes to improve screen reader support
3. **Backend Integration**: Connect to a real API for data persistence
4. **User Authentication**: Add login functionality and user roles
5. **Automated Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
