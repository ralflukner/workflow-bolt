## Version 0.1.0-alpha.5 Release (May 2025)

The latest alpha release includes significant improvements to Vite
compatibility, type safety, authentication, and code organization. This
version represents a development milestone with core functionality
implemented and enhanced stability.

### 1. Vite Version Compatibility and Build System Updates

- **Updated @vitejs/plugin-react to v4.4.1** for Vite 6.x
  compatibility

- **Downgraded Vite to v5** for React plugin compatibility while
  maintaining performance

- Fixed build system compatibility issues ensuring reliable development
  and production builds

- Maintained all performance optimizations while ensuring plugin
  ecosystem compatibility

### 2. Real-Time Updates and Time Synchronization

- Updated TimeContext to refresh time every second instead of every
  minute

- Made getCurrentDisplayTime use stored time consistently for better
  reliability

- Enhanced TimeControl component with useEffect and state to react to
  time changes

- Modified PatientCard to calculate wait times dynamically instead of
  once per render

- Revised PatientContext to use separate update intervals for real-time
  (6s) and simulation (1s) modes

- Expanded waitingPatients definition in metrics to include additional
  patient statuses

- Ensured consistent time handling and formatting across components

- Added proper cleanup for interval timers to prevent memory leaks

- Moved context hooks to separate files to fix ESLint warnings and
  improve Fast Refresh compatibility

### 3. Enhanced Type Safety and Code Quality

- **Replaced any type with generic in useSecureStorage hook** improving
  type safety

- Enhanced TypeScript configuration for better error detection

- Improved generic type usage across hooks and components

- Better type inference and compile-time error prevention

### 4. Auth0 Authentication Integration

- Implemented secure authentication using Auth0

- Added protected routes to secure application content

- Configured proper session persistence and redirect handling

- Enhanced error handling for authentication flows

### 5. Export Report Metrics Fixes

- **Corrected patient count in export report metrics** ensuring
  accurate reporting

- Fixed calculation bugs in patient flow statistics

- Enhanced CSV and text export functionality with proper data validation

- Improved metrics accuracy for clinical workflow analysis

### 6. Security Improvements

  application stability

- Split TimeContext into definition and provider files for better organization

- **Removed explicit localStorage caching from Auth0Provider** for
  cleaner authentication flow

- Enhanced context provider architecture with proper TypeScript interfaces

## TypeScript Improvements (April 2025)

A series of improvements were made to enhance type safety and resolve
TypeScript errors:

### 1. Expanded AppointmentStatus Type

The `AppointmentStatus` type was expanded to include a comprehensive set
of statuses:

```typescript
// Before
export type AppointmentStatus = "Scheduled" | "Confirmed" | "Cancelled";

// After
export type AppointmentStatus =
  | "Scheduled"
  | "Reminder Sent"
  | "Confirmed"
  | "Arrived"
  | "Checked In"
  | "Roomed"
  | "Appt Prep Started"
  | "Ready for MD"
  | "Seen by MD"
  | "Checked Out"
  | "No Show"
  | "Rescheduled"
  | "Cancelled";

```

This change provides more granular status tracking and better alignment
with medical office workflows.

### 2. React Type Definitions

Added missing React type definition packages:

```bash
npm install @types/react @types/react-dom

```

This resolves TypeScript errors related to React JSX elements.

### 3. TypeScript Configuration Enhancements

Updated `tsconfig.app.json` with improved React support:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  }
}

```

These settings improve compatibility with React's module system and
prevent import-related errors.

### 4. PatientCard Component Type Safety

Enhanced type safety in the PatientCard component:

- Added return type annotations to all functions

- Created an ActionButton interface for button configuration

- Added explicit type annotations for event handlers

- Fixed dynamic color classes with a type-safe lookup object

```typescript
// Before (dynamic class generation, potential runtime issue)
// className with dynamic color based on button.color
// (e.g., "bg-amber-500 hover:bg-amber-600")
// This can cause potential runtime issues with Tailwind's JIT
// compiler

// After (type-safe color mapping)
const buttonColors: Record<string, string> = {
  amber: "bg-amber-500 hover:bg-amber-600",
  purple: "bg-purple-500 hover:bg-purple-600",
};

// className now uses the pre-defined color mapping from buttonColors
// This ensures type safety and prevents runtime errors

```

This change prevents potential runtime errors from dynamic class
generation in Tailwind.

### 5. Enhanced Appointment Status UI

Updated the PatientCard component to display appointment statuses with
appropriate color coding:

```typescript
patient.appointmentStatus === "Confirmed"
  ? "bg-blue-600 text-white"
  : patient.appointmentStatus === "Reminder Sent"
    ? "bg-indigo-600 text-white"
    : patient.appointmentStatus === "Arrived" ||
        patient.appointmentStatus === "Checked In" ||
        patient.appointmentStatus === "Roomed"
      ? "bg-green-600 text-white"
      : patient.appointmentStatus === "Appt Prep Started" ||
          patient.appointmentStatus === "Ready for MD" ||
          patient.appointmentStatus === "Seen by MD" ||
          patient.appointmentStatus === "Checked Out"
        ? "bg-teal-600 text-white"
        : "bg-red-600 text-white";

```

This provides better visual distinction between different appointment statuses.
