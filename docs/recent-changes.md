# Recent Changes

This document tracks significant recent changes to the Patient Flow
Management application.

## Version 0.1.0-alpha.5 Release (May 2025)

The latest alpha release includes significant improvements to Vite
compatibility, type safety, authentication, and code organization. This
version represents a development milestone with core functionality
implemented and enhanced stability.

### 1. Vite Version Compatibility and Build System Updates

- **Updated @vitejs/plugin-react to v4.4.1** for Vite 6.x
  compatibility
- **Downgraded Vite to v5** for React plugin compatibility while
  maintaining performance
- Fixed build system compatibility issues ensuring reliable development
  and production builds
- Maintained all performance optimizations while ensuring plugin
  ecosystem compatibility

### 2. Real-Time Updates and Time Synchronization

- Updated TimeContext to refresh time every second instead of every
  minute
- Made getCurrentDisplayTime use stored time consistently for better
  reliability
- Enhanced TimeControl component with useEffect and state to react to
  time changes
- Modified PatientCard to calculate wait times dynamically instead of
  once per render
- Revised PatientContext to use separate update intervals for real-time
  (6s) and simulation (1s) modes
- Expanded waitingPatients definition in metrics to include additional
  patient statuses
- Ensured consistent time handling and formatting across components
- Added proper cleanup for interval timers to prevent memory leaks
- Moved context hooks to separate files to fix ESLint warnings and
  improve Fast Refresh compatibility

### 3. Enhanced Type Safety and Code Quality

- **Replaced any type with generic in useSecureStorage hook** improving
  type safety
- Enhanced TypeScript configuration for better error detection
- Improved generic type usage across hooks and components
- Better type inference and compile-time error prevention

### 4. Auth0 Authentication Integration

- Implemented secure authentication using Auth0
- Added protected routes to secure application content
- Configured proper session persistence and redirect handling
- Enhanced error handling for authentication flows

### 5. Export Report Metrics Fixes

- **Corrected patient count in export report metrics** ensuring
  accurate reporting
- Fixed calculation bugs in patient flow statistics
- Enhanced CSV and text export functionality with proper data validation
- Improved metrics accuracy for clinical workflow analysis

### 6. Security Improvements

- **Replaced hardcoded Auth0 credentials with placeholders** for better
  security practices
- Added proper environment variable configuration guidance
- Enhanced security documentation for production deployments
- Implemented secure credential management patterns

### 7. Context and State Management Refactoring

- **Refactored TimeContext to resolve rendering issues** improving
  application stability
- Split TimeContext into definition and provider files for better organization
- **Removed explicit localStorage caching from Auth0Provider** for
  cleaner authentication flow
- Enhanced context provider architecture with proper TypeScript interfaces

## TypeScript Improvements (April 2025)

A series of improvements were made to enhance type safety and resolve
TypeScript errors:

### 1. Expanded AppointmentStatus Type

The `AppointmentStatus` type was expanded to include a comprehensive set
of statuses:

```typescript
// Before
export type AppointmentStatus = 'Scheduled' | 'Confirmed' | 'Cancelled';

// After
export type AppointmentStatus = 
  | 'Scheduled'
  | 'Reminder Sent'
  | 'Confirmed'
  | 'Arrived'
  | 'Checked In'
  | 'Roomed'
  | 'Appt Prep Started'
  | 'Ready for MD'
  | 'Seen by MD'
  | 'Checked Out'
  | 'No Show'
  | 'Rescheduled'
  | 'Cancelled';
```

This change provides more granular status tracking and better alignment
with medical office workflows.

### 2. React Type Definitions

Added missing React type definition packages:

```bash
npm install @types/react @types/react-dom
```

This resolves TypeScript errors related to React JSX elements.

### 3. TypeScript Configuration Enhancements

Updated `tsconfig.app.json` with improved React support:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  }
}
```

These settings improve compatibility with React's module system and
prevent import-related errors.

### 4. PatientCard Component Type Safety

Enhanced type safety in the PatientCard component:

- Added return type annotations to all functions
- Created an ActionButton interface for button configuration
- Added explicit type annotations for event handlers
- Fixed dynamic color classes with a type-safe lookup object

```typescript
// Before (dynamic class generation, potential runtime issue)
// className with dynamic color based on button.color
// (e.g., "bg-amber-500 hover:bg-amber-600")
// This can cause potential runtime issues with Tailwind's JIT
// compiler

// After (type-safe color mapping)
const buttonColors: Record<string, string> = {
  amber: 'bg-amber-500 hover:bg-amber-600',
  purple: 'bg-purple-500 hover:bg-purple-600'
};

// className now uses the pre-defined color mapping from buttonColors
// This ensures type safety and prevents runtime errors
```

This change prevents potential runtime errors from dynamic class
generation in Tailwind.

### 5. Enhanced Appointment Status UI

Updated the PatientCard component to display appointment statuses with
appropriate color coding:

```typescript
patient.appointmentStatus === 'Confirmed' ? 'bg-blue-600 text-white' : 
patient.appointmentStatus === 'Reminder Sent' ? 'bg-indigo-600 text-white' : 
patient.appointmentStatus === 'Arrived' ||
  patient.appointmentStatus === 'Checked In' ||
  patient.appointmentStatus === 'Roomed' ? 'bg-green-600 text-white' : 
patient.appointmentStatus === 'Appt Prep Started' ||
  patient.appointmentStatus === 'Ready for MD' ||
  patient.appointmentStatus === 'Seen by MD' ||
  patient.appointmentStatus === 'Checked Out' ?
  'bg-teal-600 text-white' : 
'bg-red-600 text-white'
```

This provides better visual distinction between different appointment statuses.

## Areas Requiring Further Work

Based on recent changes and current state, the following improvements
are planned:

1. **Advanced Testing Framework**: Implement comprehensive unit and
   integration testing
2. **Backend API Integration**: Connect to a real API for data
   persistence and synchronization
3. **Enhanced Authentication**: Add role-based access control and user
   management
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add application performance monitoring
   and analytics
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Further enhance mobile user experience and
   offline capabilities
6. **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
7. **Advanced Reporting**: Add more sophisticated analytics and
   reporting features
8. **Real-time Notifications**: Implement push notifications for status changes
9. **Integration Capabilities**: Add support for EHR and practice
   management system integration
10. **Scalability Improvements**: Optimize for larger clinics with
    hundreds of daily patients
