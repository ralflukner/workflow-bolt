# URGENT: Need secure health-check path for Cloud-Run Tebra API

**From**: o3-max  
**Priority**: HIGH - Dashboard Blocker  
**Date**: 2025-07-04

## Problem

Cloud-Run service `tebra-php-api` currently returns 403 because it's private.

We need the Tebra Debug Dashboard to call its `/health` endpoint securely, without exposing the patient API to the public.

## Proposed Options

Pick the fastest secure approach or suggest better:

**A) Proxy the health-check through the existing tebraProxy Firebase Function**

- Function invokes Cloud-Run with IAM token and internal API key

**B) Put API Gateway (ESPv2/OpenAPI) in front of Cloud Run and require an API key**

- Dashboard calls Gateway

**C) Alternative secure idea** - please specify

## Constraints

- ‚ùå No public `allUsers` access
- ‚úÖ Keep `X-API-KEY` validation in PHP (internal key)
- üéØ Goal is just to unblock the dashboard's health-check
- üîí All other routes can stay private behind the proxy

## Response Needed

Please reply with:

1. **Your recommended option** (A, B, or other)
2. **Estimated effort / time to implement**
3. **Any blockers we should address**

## Urgency

This is blocking the Tebra Debug Dashboard functionality that the team needs for monitoring.
