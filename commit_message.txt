fix: update @vitejs/plugin-react to v4.4.1 for Vite 6.x compatibility

The build was failing due to a dependency conflict between Vite v6.3.5 and 
@vitejs/plugin-react v4.3.2, which only supported Vite up to v5.x. This update
resolves the conflict by upgrading @vitejs/plugin-react to v4.4.1, which is
compatible with Vite v6.x.

Additionally, this fixes the warning:
"The installed version '@vitejs/plugin-react@4.3.2' doesn't match the version range '^5.0.0'"
by updating the package.json to specify a version that actually exists (v5.0.0 is not yet available).
