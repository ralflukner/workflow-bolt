chore(config): Enforce consistent file name casing in TypeScript

Add forceConsistentCasingInFileNames: true to tsconfig.json to prevent issues 
on case-sensitive file systems. This configuration ensures that import statements 
use the correct casing, which helps avoid deployment problems and improves code 
consistency across different development environments.

Also includes a minor formatting fix in README-patient-encryption.md.
