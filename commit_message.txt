feat: Standardize "With Doctor" status and enhance patient tracking

This commit includes several improvements to the patient tracking system:

1. Standardize patient status naming:
   - Change 'with-doctor' to 'With Doctor' across all components and type definitions
   - Update status handling in all relevant components

2. Enhance patient data management:
   - Add room tracking for patients in various statuses
   - Add ability to edit check-in times for patients
   - Add room column to CSV exports

3. Improve import functionality:
   - Support importing check-in times and room assignments
   - Add parsing for "With Doctor" status in imported schedules
   - Update placeholder text to show new import format

4. UI/UX improvements:
   - Combine export functionality into a single button
   - Remove redundant refresh button
   - Add room selection for patients in more statuses

These changes improve consistency in status naming and enhance the ability to track patient location and timing information throughout the workflow.
