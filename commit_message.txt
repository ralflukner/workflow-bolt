docs(error-handling): Add correlation ID implementation documentation

Add comprehensive documentation explaining the correlation ID implementation
for error tracing in the Tebra PHP API. The documentation covers:

- Utility functions for generating and logging correlation IDs
- Standardized error response structure
- Different error types and their correlation ID patterns
- Benefits of consistent correlation ID implementation
- Usage examples and migration notes

This documentation provides a clear reference for developers working with
the error handling system and explains the traceability improvements.

Fixed markdown formatting issues to comply with linting requirements.
