fix(persistence): improve Firebase error handling and test reliability

This commit enhances the Firebase persistence mechanism and its tests:

- Reorganize test imports and mocks for better clarity
- Add explicit mocks for Firebase configuration and localStorage service
- Fix persistence behavior to remain enabled during Firebase errors
- Update test expectations to match the corrected behavior
- Remove redundant test case for save errors
- Modify initialization behavior to start with empty data instead of mock data
- Fix dependency array in PersistenceStatus component's useCallback hook

These changes improve the reliability of the persistence layer by ensuring
that the application continues to function properly even when Firebase
encounters temporary errors, providing a better user experience.
