feat: enhance Tebra API rate limiting and environment documentation

This commit improves the Tebra API integration and project setup documentation:

- Update rate limiting tests for Tebra API to ensure proper throttling
- Add test cases for various API methods with different rate limits
- Enhance environment setup documentation with clearer instructions
- Improve security recommendations for handling sensitive credentials
- Update documentation for environment variable management

These changes improve API reliability by ensuring proper rate limiting and
make the project setup process more straightforward for new developers.
