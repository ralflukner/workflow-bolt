feat: add Firebase Functions setup for Tebra EHR integration

This commit introduces a comprehensive setup for integrating Tebra EHR with Firebase Cloud Functions, enabling secure server-side SOAP API calls and robust data synchronization capabilities.

## Key Components

### Server-Side Implementation
- Created Firebase Functions infrastructure with Node.js 20 runtime
- Implemented TebraSoapClient class for SOAP API communication
- Added rate limiting mechanism to prevent API overload
- Developed both callable and scheduled functions for different integration needs
- Set up error handling and logging for reliable operation

### Client-Side Integration
- Created TebraApiService for type-safe interaction with Firebase Functions
- Implemented graceful fallbacks for environments without Firebase
- Added TebraIntegrationNew component with intuitive UI controls
- Integrated the component into the main Dashboard

### Documentation & Configuration
- Added detailed FIREBASE_SETUP.md with comprehensive setup instructions
- Included security best practices and troubleshooting guidance
- Configured firebase.json for proper deployment settings
- Set up package.json with required dependencies

## Features

### Firebase Functions
- tebraTestConnection: Tests API connectivity
- tebraGetPatient: Retrieves patient by ID
- tebraSearchPatients: Searches for patients by criteria
- tebraGetAppointments: Gets appointments by date
- tebraGetProviders: Retrieves all providers
- tebraCreateAppointment: Creates new appointments
- tebraUpdateAppointment: Updates existing appointments
- tebraSyncTodaysSchedule: Syncs and stores today's schedule
- tebraAutoSync: Scheduled function for automatic syncing (every 15 minutes during business hours)

### Benefits
- Improved security by moving API credentials to server-side
- Enhanced reliability with rate limiting and error handling
- Better performance through scheduled synchronization
- Simplified client-side code with type-safe interfaces
- Comprehensive documentation for future maintenance

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Tebra EHR integration, enabling secure and efficient patient data management while maintaining a clean separation between client and server responsibilities.

Remove vendor directory from Git tracking

✅ Successfully Removed Vendor Directory from Git Tracking

What was done:
• Added tebra-proxy/vendor/ to .gitignore
• Removed 2,212 PHP dependency files from Git tracking
• Verified vendor directory still exists locally for development
• Confirmed Git properly ignores vendor files

Benefits achieved:
• Reduced repository size by removing thousands of dependency files
• Follows PHP best practices for dependency management  
• Faster Git operations (clone, fetch, push) due to smaller repository
• Cleaner Git history without dependency file changes
• Vendor directory remains functional locally for development

Current status:
✅ Working directory is clean
✅ Vendor directory exists locally and is functional
✅ Git properly ignores all vendor files
✅ Repository follows PHP dependency management best practices
✅ Ready to push changes to remote repository

The PHP dependencies are still available locally for development and the 
Tebra proxy will continue to work normally. The only difference is that 
these dependency files are no longer tracked in Git, which is the correct 
approach for PHP projects using Composer.

feat: enhance HIPAA compliance with Auth0-Firebase authentication bridge and manual sync

This commit significantly improves the application's HIPAA compliance through a dedicated authentication bridge between Auth0 and Firebase, along with better patient data handling.

🔒 Security & Compliance Enhancements:
- Created authBridge.ts service for secure Auth0-Firebase token exchange
- Added JWT validation for secure access to patient data
- Implemented proper authentication checks before accessing PHI
- Added specific error handling for authentication failures
- Enhanced documentation with HIPAA compliance notes
- Improved error messages with clear HIPAA compliance context

🔄 New Features:
- Added manual sync functionality with authentication verification
- Implemented UI controls for triggering HIPAA-compliant manual syncs
- Added authentication state verification before any patient data operations
- Created useFirebaseAuth hook for consistent HIPAA-compliant authentication

🛠️ Technical Improvements:
- Added jsonwebtoken and jwks-rsa dependencies for secure token validation
- Integrated Firebase Auth for consistent authentication across the application
- Implemented singleton pattern for efficient authentication management
- Improved error handling with specific authentication error types
- Enhanced user feedback for authentication-related issues

📋 Implementation Details:
- Created authBridge.ts with AuthBridge class and useFirebaseAuth hook
- Updated tebraApiService.ts with authentication checks and HIPAA compliance
- Enhanced Firebase Functions with proper JWT validation
- Implemented user-friendly error messages for authentication failures

This implementation strengthens the application's security posture by creating a dedicated authentication bridge between Auth0 and Firebase, ensuring proper HIPAA compliance throughout the patient data workflow.
