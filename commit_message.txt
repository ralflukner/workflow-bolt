feat(testing): migrate test suite from Vitest to Jest

This commit migrates the project's test suite from Vitest to Jest:

- Replace Vitest imports with Jest equivalents in all test files
- Update mocking syntax from vi.* to jest.* throughout test files
- Add happy-dom for DOM testing environment
- Configure Jest setup in src/test/setup.ts with DOM matchers and cleanup
- Update package-lock.json with new dependencies

The migration maintains all existing test functionality while standardizing
on Jest as the primary testing framework. Both frameworks are temporarily
maintained to ensure a smooth transition.
