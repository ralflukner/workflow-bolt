fix: Add Firebase Admin initialization guards for Functions v2

In Firebase Functions v2, each revision runs as its own Cloud Run container
and Firebase Admin is not automatically initialized. This caused errors when
modules that use Firebase Admin were imported before the main initialization
in index.js.

Changes:
- Added initialization guard to src/monitoring.js
- Added initialization guard to src/services/firestoreDailySession.ts
- Created README.md with deployment instructions

This fixes the "Error: The default Firebase app does not exist" that was
occurring when the functions were deployed to v2 runtime.
