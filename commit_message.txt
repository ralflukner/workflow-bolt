feat(tebra): Implement Tebra API integration with debugging tools

This commit adds comprehensive integration with the Tebra EHR API via SOAP, 
including appointment retrieval, patient data handling, and persistence improvements.

Key changes:
- Enhanced TebraSoapClient with robust error handling and rate limiting
- Added type definitions for Tebra API entities (patients, appointments, providers)
- Implemented Firebase debugging tools to diagnose persistence issues
- Created utility functions for testing Tebra appointment retrieval
- Added date debugging utilities to ensure proper date formatting
- Updated Dashboard and DiagnosticPanel to include new debugging components
- Improved PatientContext to better handle data from Tebra API
- Added SOAP UI project file for API testing and documentation
- Corrected an erroneous 't' entry in .gitignore

These changes enable the application to reliably fetch and display patient 
appointments from Tebra EHR, with proper error handling and debugging capabilities
to ensure smooth integration in production environments.
