docs: Move markdown files to docs directory

Reorganized the repository by moving all markdown (.md) files to the docs
directory for better organization and maintainability. This change makes
the repository structure cleaner and more consistent.

Changes:
- Moved all documentation files to the docs directory
- Kept README.md in the root directory as it's conventionally used as the landing page
- Maintained git history for all moved files

This implements the requested change to "move the .md files into the docs
directory and put them in there from now on."
