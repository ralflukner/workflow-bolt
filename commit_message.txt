feat: add Firebase Functions setup for Tebra EHR integration

This commit introduces a comprehensive setup for integrating Tebra EHR with Firebase Cloud Functions, enabling secure server-side SOAP API calls and robust data synchronization capabilities.

## Key Components

### Server-Side Implementation
- Created Firebase Functions infrastructure with Node.js 20 runtime
- Implemented TebraSoapClient class for SOAP API communication
- Added a rate limiting mechanism to prevent API overload
- Developed both callable and scheduled functions for different integration needs
- Set up error handling and logging for reliable operation

### Client-Side Integration
- Created TebraApiService for type-safe interaction with Firebase Functions
- Implemented graceful fallbacks for environments without Firebase
- Added TebraIntegrationNew component with intuitive UI controls
- Integrated the component into the main Dashboard

### Documentation & Configuration
- Added detailed FIREBASE_SETUP.md with comprehensive setup instructions
- Included security best practices and troubleshooting guidance
- Configured firebase.json for proper deployment settings
- Set up package.json with required dependencies

## Features

### Firebase Functions
- tebraTestConnection: Tests API connectivity
- tebraGetPatient: Retrieves patient by ID
- tebraSearchPatients: Searches for patients by criteria
- tebraGetAppointments: Gets appointments by date
- tebraGetProviders: Retrieves all providers
- tebraCreateAppointment: Creates new appointments
- tebraUpdateAppointment: Updates existing appointments
- tebraSyncTodaysSchedule: Syncs and stores today's schedule
- tebraAutoSync: Scheduled function for automatic syncing (every 15 minutes during business hours)

### Benefits
- Improved security by moving API credentials to server-side
- Enhanced reliability with rate limiting and error handling
- Better performance through scheduled synchronization
- Simplified client-side code with type-safe interfaces
- Comprehensive documentation for future maintenance

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Tebra EHR integration, enabling secure and efficient patient data management while maintaining a clean separation between client and server responsibilities.

Remove vendor directory from Git tracking

‚úÖ Successfully Removed Vendor Directory from Git Tracking

What was done:
‚Ä¢ Added tebra-proxy/vendor/ to .gitignore
‚Ä¢ Removed 2,212 PHP dependency files from Git tracking
‚Ä¢ Verified vendor directory still exists locally for development
‚Ä¢ Confirmed Git properly ignores vendor files

Benefits achieved:
‚Ä¢ Reduced repository size by removing thousands of dependency files
‚Ä¢ Follows PHP best practices for dependency management  
‚Ä¢ Faster Git operations (clone, fetch, push) due to smaller repository
‚Ä¢ Cleaner Git history without dependency file changes
‚Ä¢ Vendor directory remains functional locally for development

Current status:
‚úÖ Working directory is clean
‚úÖ Vendor directory exists locally and is functional
‚úÖ Git properly ignores all vendor files
‚úÖ Repository follows PHP dependency management best practices
‚úÖ Ready to push changes to remote repository

The PHP dependencies are still available locally for development and the 
Tebra proxy will continue to work normally. The only difference is that 
these dependency files are no longer tracked in Git, which is the correct 
approach for PHP projects using Composer.

feat(auth): enhance Auth0-Firebase bridge with robust testing and advanced features

This commit significantly improves the Auth0-Firebase authentication bridge with comprehensive testing and advanced features for better reliability, security, and debugging capabilities.

üß™ Testing Enhancements:
- Added extensive unit tests for AuthBridge class and useFirebaseAuth hook
- Implemented integration tests covering real-world authentication scenarios
- Added tests for error handling, token validation, and retry mechanisms
- Created test mocks for Auth0 and Firebase interactions

üîí Security & Performance Features:
- Implemented token caching with proper expiration handling
- Added token validation with expiry checks and format verification
- Created retry logic with exponential backoff for network resilience
- Added Firebase auth state monitoring for better debugging
- Implemented health check functionality for system monitoring

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements:
- Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages
- Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting
- Implemented performance tracking for authentication operations
- Added support for silent token refresh with popup fallback
- Created utility functions for cache management and debugging

üìã Implementation Details:
- Enhanced AuthBridge class with a singleton pattern and improved methods
- Expanded useFirebaseAuth hook with additional utility functions
- Added onAuthStateChanged listener for Firebase auth state monitoring
- Implemented structured debug information collection
- Created a health check system with status reporting

This implementation provides a more robust, reliable authentication system with comprehensive testing and advanced features to ensure secure access to patient data while maintaining HIPAA compliance.
