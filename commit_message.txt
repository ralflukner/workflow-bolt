fix: correct patient count in export report metrics

- Updated the "Patients Waiting" metric in the export report to use the same patient filter as the wait time calculations
- Ensured consistent metrics calculation throughout the export report
- Fixed issue where metrics were showing 0 except for the number of patients
- Removed unused variables to improve code quality
