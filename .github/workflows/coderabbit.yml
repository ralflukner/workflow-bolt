# CodeRabbit is now integrated via GitHub App, not GitHub Actions
# This workflow file is kept for reference but is no longer needed
# 
# To use CodeRabbit:
# 1. Install the CodeRabbit GitHub App from https://github.com/apps/coderabbitai
# 2. Configure it in your repository settings
# 3. CodeRabbit will automatically review PRs without needing this workflow
#
# You can safely delete this file once CodeRabbit App is installed
