    "body": "Hi team,\nCloud-Run service tebra-php-api currently returns 403 because it’s private.\nWe need the Tebra Debug Dashboard to call its /health endpoint securely, without exposing the patient API to the public.\nProposed options—pick the fastest secure approach or suggest better:\nA) Proxy the health-check through the existing tebraProxy Firebase Function (function invokes Cloud-Run with IAM token and internal API key).\nB) Put API Gateway (ESPv2/OpenAPI) in front of Cloud Run and require an API key; dashboard calls Gateway.\nC) Alternative secure idea—please specify.\nConstraints:\nNo public allUsers access.\nKeep X-API-KEY validation in PHP (internal key).\nGoal is just to unblock the dashboard’s health-check; all other routes can stay private behind the proxy.\nPlease reply with:\nYour recommended option (A, B, or other).\nEstimated effort / time to implement.\nAny blockers we should address.\nThanks!\n— o3-max",
