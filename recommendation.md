# Version Update Recommendation

## Current Status

- The application was previously at version 0.0.0, typically indicating
  an initial development phase with no official releases.
- The application now has several significant features implemented:
  - Auth0 authentication integration
  - Real-time and simulated time handling
  - Patient flow management functionality
  - Netlify deployment configuration

## Changes Made

- Updated version from 0.0.0 to 0.1.0 in:
  - package.json
  - package-lock.json
- Verified that the build process completes successfully with the new
  version

## Justification

According to the semantic versioning (SemVer) principles:

- MAJOR version (1.0.0) indicates production-ready software with a stable
  API
- MINOR version (0.1.0) indicates new functionality in a backward-compatible
  manner
- PATCH version (0.0.1) indicates backward-compatible bug fixes

The update to version 0.1.0 is appropriate because:

1. The application has moved beyond the initial development phase (0.0.0)
2. Core features have been implemented and are functional
3. Recent improvements to time handling and component updates demonstrate
   ongoing development
4. The application is not yet considered production-ready (1.0.0)

## Next Steps

- Continue development and bug fixes
- Consider updating to version 0.2.0 when significant new features are
  added
- Consider updating to version 1.0.0 when the application is considered
  stable and production-ready

## Conclusion

Updating to version 0.1.0 accurately reflects the current state of the
application as a functional development project with core features
implemented but not yet production-ready.
