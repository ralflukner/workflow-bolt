## Reporting a Vulnerability
Since I'm both the developer and a user
of this application, I take security
seriously. If you discover a security

   - Potential impact
   - Suggestions for remediation (if
   any)

3. Response Timeline: As a solo
developer, I'll acknowledge your
report within 48 hours and provide an
estimated timeline for addressing the
issue.

4. Resolution Process:
   - I'll investigate the reported
   vulnerability
   - Develop and test a fix
   - Release a patched version as
   quickly as possible
   - Credit you in the release notes
   (unless you prefer to remain
   anonymous)

5. Disclosure: Please allow me
reasonable time to address the issue
before any public disclosure.

## Security Best Practices
As the sole developer and user, I follow
these security practices:
- Regular dependency updates to patch
known vulnerabilities
- Code reviews of my own work before
committing changes
- Static code analysis using automated
tools
- Regular backups of all data
- Strong authentication practices for all
development and deployment
environments

## Personal Security Measures
Since I use this application myself, I
implement these additional measures:
- Regular updates to the latest version
- Secure storage of any sensitive data
- Regular monitoring of application logs
for unusual activity
- Keeping my development environment
secure and up-to-date

Thank you for helping keep this project
secure!
