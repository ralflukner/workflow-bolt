## Deployment Process

To deploy this project to Netlify:

1. **Create a Netlify account** if you don't have one already.

2. **Deploy to Netlify** using one of these methods:

   - **Git Integration (Recommended)**: Connect your
     GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository to Netlify for continuous
     deployment.
   - **Manual Deploy**: Run `npm run build` locally and drag-and-drop
     the `dist` folder to Netlify's manual deploy area.
   - **Netlify CLI**: Install the Netlify CLI
     (`npm install -g netlify-cli`) and run `netlify deploy`.

3. **Configure environment variables** in the Netlify UI:

   - Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment
   - Add the following variables:

     ```bash
     VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain.region.auth0.com
     VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
     VITE_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-netlify-site-name.netlify.app
     VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://api.patientflow.com
     VITE_APP_NAME=Patient Flow Management
     ```

   - Replace the placeholders with your actual values:
     - `your-auth0-domain.region.auth0.com`: Your Auth0 domain from your
       Auth0 account
     - `your-auth0-client-id`: Your Auth0 client ID from your Auth0 account
     - `your-netlify-site-name.netlify.app`: Your actual Netlify domain

   > **Important**: You must create your own Auth0 account and
   > application to obtain the necessary credentials. Never use shared or
   > example credentials in a production environment.

4. **Update Auth0 configuration**:
   - Log in to your Auth0 Dashboard
   - Go to Applications > Your Application > Settings
   - Add your Netlify domain to "Allowed Callback URLs", "Allowed Logout
     URLs", and "Allowed Web Origins"

## Next Steps

After deployment, verify that:

1. The application loads correctly
2. Authentication works properly
3. All features function as expected

If you encounter any issues, check the Netlify deployment logs and the
browser console for errors.
