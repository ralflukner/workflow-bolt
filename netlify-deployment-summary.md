## Deployment Process

To deploy this project to Netlify:

1. **Create a Netlify account** if you don't have one already.

2. **Deploy to Netlify** using one of these methods:
   - **Git Integration (Recommended)**: Connect your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository to Netlify for continuous deployment.
   - **Manual Deploy**: Run `npm run build` locally and drag-and-drop the `dist` folder to Netlify's manual deploy area.
   - **Netlify CLI**: Install the Netlify CLI (`npm install -g netlify-cli`) and run `netlify deploy`.

3. **Configure environment variables** in the Netlify UI:
   - Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=dev-uex7qzqmd8c4qnde.us.auth0.com
     VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=I8ZHr1uCjPkO4ePgY6S421N9HQ0nnN7A
     VITE_AUTH0_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-netlify-site-name.netlify.app
     VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://api.patientflow.com
     VITE_APP_NAME=Patient Flow Management
     ```
   - Replace `your-netlify-site-name.netlify.app` with your actual Netlify domain.

4. **Update Auth0 configuration**:
   - Log in to your Auth0 Dashboard
   - Go to Applications > Your Application > Settings
   - Add your Netlify domain to "Allowed Callback URLs", "Allowed Logout URLs", and "Allowed Web Origins"

## Next Steps

After deployment, verify that:
1. The application loads correctly
2. Authentication works properly
3. All features function as expected
