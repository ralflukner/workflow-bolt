# Project Management Structure

## 📁 Directory Organization

This folder contains project management structures that correlate with external project management tools like Trello, GitHub Issues, Notion, and other platforms.

### **Project Folders**

| Project | Status | PM Tool | Description |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **redis-2fa-auth** | 🟢 Active | GitHub Issues | Redis 2FA authentication system |
| **multi-ai-collaboration** | 🟢 Active | GitHub Issues + Trello | Multi-AI coordination platform |
| **specialized-ai-registry** | 🟡 Planning | GitHub Issues | Registry for specialized AI agents |
| **cost-optimization** | 🟡 Planning | TBD | AI service cost management |
| **templates** | 📚 Reference | N/A | Reusable project templates |

### **Integration Strategy**

#### **GitHub Issues Integration**
- Each project folder contains GitHub issue templates
- Automatic labeling and assignment via GitHub Actions
- Cross-references between project files and GitHub issues

#### **Trello Integration**  
- Trello board configurations for visual project management
- Card templates that mirror project folder structure
- Automation rules for card movement and notifications

#### **Multi-Platform Sync**
- Consistent project structure across all platforms
- Automated synchronization between tools
- Single source of truth with multi-platform views

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### **Project Lifecycle**
```
1. Project Initiation
   └── Create project folder in prj-mgmt/
   └── Set up corresponding Trello board
   └── Create GitHub Issues templates
   └── Define AI agent assignments

2. Active Development
   └── Daily updates in project folders
   └── Trello card movements
   └── GitHub issue progress tracking
   └── AI agent collaboration logs

3. Project Completion
   └── Archive project artifacts
   └── Export lessons learned
   └── Update templates with improvements
   └── Archive external tool boards
```

### **Cross-Platform Correlation**

#### **Naming Conventions**
- **Folder names**: kebab-case (e.g., `redis-2fa-auth`)
- **Trello boards**: Title Case (e.g., "Redis 2FA Authentication")
- **GitHub labels**: lowercase/hyphen (e.g., `project/redis-2fa-auth`)
- **Issue titles**: [Project] format (e.g., "[Redis-2FA] Deploy system")

#### **Status Synchronization**
```yaml
Project Folder Status → External Tools:
  🟢 Active → GitHub: Open issues, Trello: In Progress
  🟡 Planning → GitHub: Backlog label, Trello: Planning column
  🔴 Blocked → GitHub: Blocked label, Trello: Blocked column
  ✅ Complete → GitHub: Closed issues, Trello: Done column
  📚 Reference → GitHub: Documentation label, Trello: Archived
```

## 📋 Project Templates
