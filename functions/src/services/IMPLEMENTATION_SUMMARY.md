# Email Service Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented a solution to send HIPAA security alert emails through Google Workspace (Gmail) using OAuth2 authentication. This implementation allows the monitoring system to send security alerts to lukner@luknerclinic.com when security events are detected.

## Changes Made

1. **Created Email Service Module**
   - Created a new file: `functions/src/services/emailService.js`
   - Implemented OAuth2 authentication with Gmail
   - Added a function to send emails using Nodemailer with Gmail transport

2. **Updated Monitoring Module**
   - Modified the `sendEmailAlert` method in `functions/src/monitoring.js`
   - Integrated the email service to send actual emails
   - Added error handling and logging for email sending operations

3. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Added `nodemailer` and `googleapis` to `package.json`
   - These packages are required for OAuth2 authentication and email sending

4. **Added Documentation**
   - Created a README with setup instructions
   - Included steps to create OAuth2 credentials
   - Added instructions for generating a refresh token
   - Provided commands to configure environment variables

## How It Works

1. When a security event is detected, the `triggerSecurityAlert` method is called
2. This method calls `sendEmailAlert` with the alert details
3. `sendEmailAlert` uses the email service to send an email to lukner@luknerclinic.com
4. The email includes details about the security event and recommended actions

## Required Configuration

Before the email service can work, you need to:

1. Create OAuth2 credentials in the Google Cloud Console
2. Generate a refresh token using the OAuth 2.0 Playground
3. Configure the following environment variables:
   - `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID`
   - `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN`

Detailed setup instructions are available in the README.md file.
## Deployment
...
After configuring the OAuth2 credentials and environment variables, deploy the functions with:

```bash
gcloud functions deploy FUNCTION_NAME
  --gen2
  --runtime=nodejs20
  --region=us-central1
  --set-env-vars="GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID,GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET,GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
```

Replace `FUNCTION_NAME` with the name of the function you want to deploy, and the environment variables with your actual credentials.

## Testing

To test the email functionality, you can trigger a security alert by:

1. Simulating excessive authentication failures
2. Creating unusual PHI access patterns
3. Exceeding rate limits

The system will detect these anomalies and send an email alert to lukner@luknerclinic.com.

## Benefits

- **Security**: Uses OAuth2 for secure authentication
- **Reliability**: Sends emails directly through Google Workspace
- **Compliance**: Maintains HIPAA compliance for security alerts
- **Maintainability**: Modular design for easy updates
