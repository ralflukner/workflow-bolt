2. Auth0-Firebase Authentication Bridge Enhancements
   - Added comprehensive testing for authentication flows
   - Implemented token caching with expiration handling
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Improved error handling and debugging capabilities

3. Repository Maintenance
   - Removed vendor directory from Git tracking (2,212 PHP files)
