Remove vendor directory from Git tracking

✅ Successfully Removed Vendor Directory from Git Tracking

What was done:
• Added tebra-proxy/vendor/ to .gitignore
• Removed 2,212 PHP dependency files from Git tracking
• Verified vendor directory still exists locally for development
• Confirmed Git properly ignores vendor files

Benefits achieved:
• Reduced repository size by removing thousands of dependency files
• Follows PHP best practices for dependency management  
• Faster Git operations (clone, fetch, push) due to smaller repository
• Cleaner Git history without dependency file changes
• Vendor directory remains functional locally for development

Current status:
✅ Working directory is clean
✅ Vendor directory exists locally and is functional
✅ Git properly ignores all vendor files
✅ Repository follows PHP dependency management best practices
✅ Ready to push changes to remote repository

The PHP dependencies are still available locally for development and the 
Tebra proxy will continue to work normally. The only difference is that 
these dependency files are no longer tracked in Git, which is the correct 
approach for PHP projects using Composer.
