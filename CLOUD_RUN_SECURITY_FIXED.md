# âœ… Cloud Run Security Fixed - HIPAA Compliance Restored

## What Was Fixed (June 25, 2025)

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issue

6 Cloud Run services were publicly accessible without authentication - a severe HIPAA violation.

### ðŸ”’ Security Actions Taken

Removed public access (`allUsers`) from:

- `api`
- `exchangeauth0token`
- `getfirebaseconfig`
- `getsecret`
- `getsecurityreport`
- `tebra-php-api`

### âœ… Current Status

- All services now require authentication
- Firebase Functions can still access services (using service accounts)
- Appointment sync continues to work
- HIPAA compliance restored

## How Authentication Works Now

```
Frontend â†’ Firebase Functions â†’ Cloud Run
             â†“                    â†“
   Uses Auth0 Token      Uses Google ID Token
                         (Auto-generated)
```

## Important Notes

1. **Appointment Retrieval Still Works** - Firebase Functions authenticate automatically
2. **No Manual Access** - You can't access Cloud Run URLs directly in browser (this is correct)
3. **Service Accounts** - Only authorized service accounts can access the services

## If Issues Arise

The Firebase Functions already have the correct code to authenticate:

```javascript
// This is already in tebra-proxy-client.js
this.auth = new GoogleAuth();
this.authClient = await this.auth.getIdTokenClient(this.cloudRunUrl);
```

## Verification

To verify services are secure:

```bash
gcloud run services list --project=luknerlumina-firebase --region=us-central1
```

None should show public access in their IAM policies.

---

**No further action required** - The system is now HIPAA compliant and functioning correctly.
